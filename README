About:
	This is a library for the php framework Codeignitor http://codeigniter.com to make API calls to the Authorize.net CIM interface.
	This is free to use. It would be nice if you make updates if you submitted them.

Files:
	- example.php -> Controller file used to test this library. Good place to start, and some good commits to help understand.
	- authorizenet.php -> Config file for the library.
	- AuthorizeCim.php -> Main library file.
	- README -> This File.
	- CIM_XML_guide.pdf -> Authorize.net API document this library is based on.

Install:
	- Copy AuthorizeCim.php to /system/application/libraries/
	- Copy authorizenet.php to /private/application/config/
	- Edit vars in authorizenet.php
	
Usage:
	- In a controller $this->load->library('AuthorizeCim')
	
Functions:
	$this->authorizecim->get_customers()
	$this->authorizecim->submit_profile(yourcustomerid, description, email)
	$this->authorizecim->update_profile(profileid, yourcustomerid, description, email)
	$this->authorizecim->submit_paymentprofile(profileid, creditcardnumber, expire, creditcardcode)
	$this->authorizecim->update_paymentprofile(profileid, paymentid, creditcardnumber, expire, creditcardcode)
	$this->authorizecim->submit_transaction_authonly(profileid, paymentid, amount)
	$this->authorizecim->submit_transaction_authcap(profileid, paymentid, amount)
	$this->authorizecim->submit_transaction_refund(profileid, paymentid, amount, transactionid)
	$this->authorizecim->get_customer(profileid)
	$this->authorizecim->delete_customer(profileid)

Still Todo (9/22/2009):
	- Better library function argument validation.
	- Better Documention
	- Better function defaults
	- Finish providing full support for the API defined in CIM_XML_guide.pdf
			Missing -> (createCustomerShippingRequest, deleteCustomerShippingRequest, updateCustomerShippingRequest,
									deleteCustomerPaymentProfileRequest, validateCustomerPaymentProfileRequest, 
									getCustomerPaymentProfileRequest, getCustomerShippingAddressRequest, validateCustomerPaymentProfileRequest)
	- Some API calls are missing some optional data sets.
	- Complete all the different Transaction calls. Only have done; Auth, Auth & Capture, Refund
